# Bamazon-cli-app

#### Application Function
This application is a mimicry of an amazon client side storefront accessed through the command line. Over time it can be applied to a user interface to help people shop.

#### Overview
- One function of the application is to create a database that houses all the information about a product, how much it costs, and how many there are in stock
- Another function is to display the whole product inventory to the guest upon activation. 
  - The user will be able to see the product list and choose which product they would like to buy and how many
- If there is enough in stock, the program will display how much it costs and then deduct the quantity from the quantity in stock and update the database.
- The program will then prompt the user if they would like to keep shopping or exit.
  - If the user would llike to keep shopping, it will show them the products list again
  - If they would not like to keep shopping, it will exit them out of the program.

##### How to run the app
